# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

## Project Overview
The Credit Card Fraud Detection project aims to build and evaluate machine learning models for identifying fraudulent transactions in credit card data. It leverages various classification algorithms and provides a detailed analysis of features and model performance.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - CatBoost
  - AdaBoost
- **Libraries**:
  - Scikit-learn
  - XGBoost
  - CatBoost
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
- **Jupyter Notebook**: To execute and document the code.
- **PDF Document**: Visualizations provided in [Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection_Visualizations.pdf](Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection_Visualizations.pdf).

## Project Structure
- **Data Exploration**: Understand the distribution and characteristics of the dataset.
- **Feature Analysis**: Investigate feature importance and relationships using correlation plots and feature importance metrics.
- **Model Evaluation**: Compare models based on confusion matrices and feature importance.
- **Visualizations**: Includes class distribution, feature importance, correlation plots, and transaction patterns.

## Key Files
- **Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection_Model.ipynb**: Contains all the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection_Visualizations_With_Name.pdf**: Compilation of all visualizations used in the project.
- **Data Files**: The project uses publicly available datasets for credit card fraud detection.

## Key Insights
1. **Class Imbalance**: Fraudulent transactions form a small percentage of the dataset.
2. **Feature Importance**: Certain features (e.g., V14, V12) have a significant impact on detecting fraudulent transactions.
3. **Model Comparison**: XGBoost and Random Forest provided high accuracy and balanced performance.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the project files including the Jupyter Notebook and PDF visualizations.
2. **Run the Notebook**: Execute the cells in `Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection_Model.ipynb` to see the results.
3. **Review Visualizations**: Open the PDF file for a visual summary of the data analysis and model performance.

## Future Scope
- Integrate real-time data streams.
- Enhance feature engineering for better model accuracy.
- Explore deep learning models for further improvements.
